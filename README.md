Graceful degredation and service workers are related because GD is the concept of an application not catastrophically failing if parts start failing, and service wrokers are a tool that helps the network side of that. Computers need to load assets from website by downloading them, but if something on the website's end fails, service workers are meant to step in and provide the cached versions of those assets so the website still works smoothly
